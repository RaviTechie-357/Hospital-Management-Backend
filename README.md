Hospital Management Backend
Author: Ravindra Dhage

This project involves the development of a backend system for hospital management, utilizing multiple APIs to facilitate various operations. The system is built on a MySQL database, with several entities created to structure and manage data effectively within the database tables. Below is a brief overview of the project's flow:

Project Structure:

Entity Creation:

The project began with the creation of entity classes, each containing all the necessary attributes required for the system. These attributes are encapsulated as private, with corresponding getters and setters provided via a constructor.
Each entity class is annotated with @Entity, which facilitates the creation of corresponding tables in the database.

Repository Layer:
For each entity, a repository interface was created by extending JpaRepository. This approach leverages JPA's extensive features, simplifying the implementation of data access layers.
The repository interfaces are annotated with @Repository to indicate that they are Spring Data repositories.

Controller Layer:

The controller layer directly interacts with the repository layer to handle client requests and perform necessary operations. It serves as the bridge between the frontend and backend.
Various HTTP methods such as @Post, @Delete, and @Get are utilized to manage CRUD operations. The @Controller annotation is used to define each controller class.
The @CrossOrigin annotation is applied to enable seamless integration between the frontend and backend.


Summary:
This overview provides a brief explanation of the structure and flow of the backend system I developed for hospital management. The project is designed to efficiently manage data and operations, ensuring smooth integration with the frontend and effective use of the MySQL database.
